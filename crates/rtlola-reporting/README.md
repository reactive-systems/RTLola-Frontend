# RTLola Reporting

RTLola is a stream-based runtime verification framework.  It parses an RTLola specification, analyses it, and generates executable monitors for it.
The framework is separated into a front-end and several back-ends.

This crate is part of the RTLola front-end, which includes several sub-modules:
* Main Crate: The RTLola front-end: [crates.io/crates/rtlola-frontend](rtlola-frontend) 
* A parser for RTLola specifications: [crates.io/crates/rtlola-parser](rtlola-parser) 
* The RTLola high-level intermediate representation including a strong static analysis: [crates.io/crates/rtlola-hir](rtlola-hir)
* Procedural macros: [crates.io/crates/rtlola-macros](rtlola-macros)
